Gas leakage leads to severe accidents resulting in severe losses and  human injuries gas leakage occurs mainly due to poor maintenance of equipments and inadequate awareness of the people. Hence, LPG leakage detection is essential to prevent accidents and to save human lives. It uses MQ5 sensor to detect inflammable gas and when it reaches a particular threshold, it send an sms to the owner through webhooks and switches off the gas cylinder using motors.

For further study of the gas leak, one might see it in the Thingspeak cloud which shows the concentration of the gas leak at appropriate intervals of time.
